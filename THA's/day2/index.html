                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With due respect, my name is Anand from SE IT department, having roll no 0x123asf.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing this letter to request permission for attending a coding bootcamp. I recently came across Devsnest which provides 6 months of training in
                    different domains of programming and I am very much willing to enroll for the batch starting next month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bootcamp being a really important and integral part of my learning procedure, I request you to consider my situation and grant me permission for the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forward to your kind consideration.
                </p>
